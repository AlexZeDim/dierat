# Dierat

Yet another one bot, that handle the voice chat moderation problem.
 
If user joins a voice channel in managing category, the bot will create a new voice channel. And on leave event, it will remove the voice channel.

Default status:

 - Primary category
   + Sub Voice channel
   + Sub Voice channel (x)
 
Bot is named after `Ryoi` and his *die-rat* nickname pronunciation.

## Permissions

Dierat need `rename user` permissions and the most top role above all others. It doesn't need admin or any other special permissions. But anyway, since the code is open-sourced you could give to the bot any permissions and it won't abuse it.
If bot doesn't rename the user, well, mainly because lack of permissions.
